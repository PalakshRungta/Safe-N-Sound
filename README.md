The following project was made at SD Hacks 2019. We believe our product comes under the category "Health and Wellbeing".

Our code attempts to solve the problem of texting and driving for drivers using facial detection and recognition. Our program alerts the driver using a beeper if it senses that the driver is not looking at the road. We planned on incorporating a Raspberry Pi to do so, however, could not implement it due to the lack of time and equipment.

Follow these instructions to try the code for yourself!

Step 1: Download the .zip file.

Step 2: Ensure you have all the packages downloaded before you run code.

Step 3: Run the detector.py code first. To enable smooth face detection, allow the code to scan your face and try to stay still under good lighting conditions.

Step 4: Run the 'recognizer.py' code to test out the facial recognition and the alert system (which is limited to a print statement alerting the driving to look at the road currently).

Step 5: If there is an out of range error when running 'recognizer.py', please try again from Step 3.
