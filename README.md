The following project was made at SD Hacks 2019. We believe our product comes under the category "Health and Wellbeing".

Our code attempts to solve the problem of texting and driving for drivers using facial detection and recognition. We planned the program to alert the driver using a beeper if it senses that the driver is not looking at the road, using a Raspberry Pi to do so, however we could not implement it due to the lack of time and equipment.

Follow these instructions to try the code for yourself!

Step 1: Download the .zip file.

Step 2: Ensure you have all the packages downloaded before you run code.

Step 3: Run the detector.py code first. To enable smooth face detection, allow the code to scan your face and try to stay still under good lighting conditions.

Step 4: Run the 'recognizer.py' code to test out the facial recognition and the alert system (which is limited to a print statement alerting the driving to look at the road currently).

Step 5: If Step 3 is not followed carefully, there can be a possible out of range error when running 'recognizer.py'. In this case please try all steps again from Step 3.
